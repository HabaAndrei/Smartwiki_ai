## Technologies

In our tech stack, we leverage Python as the primary programming language due to its versatility, robustness, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. 
Flask serves as our web framework, providing a lightweight yet powerful foundation for building web applications. 
In the production environment, we deploy our applications using Gunicorn, a WSGI HTTP server for Unix platforms, renowned for its scalability and reliability.




For documentation purposes, we have adopted a sophisticated model provided by LangChain, specifically tailored for handling Wikipedia-related content. 
This model incorporates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, enabling us to extract, analyze, and present information from Wikipedia articles in a structured and user-friendly format.
By leveraging LangChain's model, we ensure that our documentation remains comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date, meeting the highest standards of quality and reliability.
