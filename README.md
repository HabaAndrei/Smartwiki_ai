## Technologies

I'm using Python as the programming language, with Flask as the server and Gunicorn in the production environment.
For documentation, I utilize a model provided by LangChain for all Wikipedia-related content.

## Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.
